### Overview

In this assignment, we built a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS. The completed work must look just like the image provided to us.


### Instructions

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `HW-Wireframe`.
2. Clone this repository to your computer by following the process we went over in class.
3. Navigate to the `HW-Wireframe` folder you just cloned onto your machine. Then create two files inside this folder: `index.html` and `style.css`.
4. Make your initial Git commit and push it to GitHub. 
   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>"`
   * `git push origin master`
   * If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub. 
5. Return to your local copies of `index.html` and `style.css`. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS. 
   * All of your HTML should be inside of the `index.html` file. 
   * All of your CSS should be inside of the `style.css` file.
6. When you finish the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo. Remember:
   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>"`
   * `git push origin master`
